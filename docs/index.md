# Setting up Communications
## Admin Matters:
- This repository will be used to assign tasks for the week.
- All weekly tasks will be listed here in the ReadME.md. We will assign tasks during/after the weekly team meetings.
- All codes will be documented here. Reading materials will be linked here and downloads will be uploaded to the teams channel.
- Bring up code-related issues in the issues tab of this repo. Tag it with the apt tag.
- Other issues can be posted on the discussions forum of the team on github or the group telegram chat.
- If you are not too familiar with the usage of github, do not worry we will briefly go through it in the first Comms meeting!
- First off, click on **Watch** located at the top of the repo screen to get updates related to the repository.
- Secondly, the general rule of thumb when adding/removing/editing code in any of the Comms repos and subrepos is this:
1. For the first time you are contributing to the repository: remember to fork it to your account. This creates a new repository under your account, where you can edit and branch code. You can commit and push changes to your fork BUT DO NOT COMMIT CHANGES DIRECTLY TO THIS REPOSITORY.
2. Once you have made changes to your forked repo, you can make a **pull request** to the main repo. From there on, the comms leads will review the code and merge/not merge it with the main code accordingly.

### **Are you new to git source code control?**
Here are some links that will help:
1. [Git Tutorial](https://git-scm.com/docs/gittutorial)
2. [Git Branching Workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow)

We'll do an example of general workflow in the 1st team meeting. Before that, do the 1st part of the workflow procedure as specified [HERE.](tasks/workflowpractice.md)

### **Know Your ROS**
Shock! Horror! ROS may sound daunting to people new to it, but fret not! There is an abundance of great resources on the web to help you get kickstarted with ROS.
- You can read up ROS tutorials [HERE.](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials)
- Or watch [this youtube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJNGprAk4DF5PY0kB866fEZfz6zMLJTF8) on ROS.
Start early so that you know how to go about it as our system will be primarily based on ROS. You would require a linux based machine to work with ROS. We'd reccomend installing [Linux Subsystem for Windows](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) or in case you are using a Mac, you might want to consider [partitioning your laptop](https://www.lifewire.com/dual-boot-linux-and-mac-os-4125733) (not reccomended, just due to risk of losing data on your laptop). Alternatively, you could try using a virtual OS layer like Parallels or VirtualBox.
