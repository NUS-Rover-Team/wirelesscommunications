# Week 6: Back from the Dead!
Alright, it has been a while since we worked on this due many things in the middle like hackathon and all.

Mid - December, we must have a basic system setup and ordered all equipment by then.

Lets see what we have in store for this week onwards:

1. Team Meeting to Finalise Architecture

To be held on: 19.11.20

Having a system architecture is crucial to us selecting hardware like the transceivers. 

2. **Before the meeting**

If you have the time, do consider looking into different kind sof wireless comms systems and their advantages.

3. ROS and Comms!

* Here is a tutorial on how to set up a network using ROS: [Setting Up a ROS Network: WiFi + Ethernet](https://risc.readthedocs.io/2-ros-network-wifi-ethernet.html)
* An article on basic networking with ROS using the example of a drone. Has a basic system architecture too! [Click here.](https://risc.readthedocs.io/2-networking.html)
* A github repo that talks about network integration in NVIDIA Jetson TX2: [Link to repo.](https://github.com/ethz-asl/mav_dji_ros_interface/wiki/NVIDIA-Jetson-TX2-integration)
* **EXTRA:**[Robot to robot comms with ROS, a very cool research paper!](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/334205565_Development_of_a_wireless_communication_platform_for_multiple-mobile_robots_using_ROS)
