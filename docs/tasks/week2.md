# Week 2: Literature Review and Hardware Selection

### 3. How do we Communicate?

- We require wireless communication to transfer data between the base station and the rover.
- What are the possible ways to make this communication possible?
- How can we organise the data packets?
- What are the possible issues/shortcomings?
- How do we use ROS to communicate?

### 4. Antenna Selection

- Watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46SbGxS73dY) explaining antenna fundamentals.
- An article on increasing range in wireless communication: [click here](http://robotsforroboticists.com/long-distance-wireless-communications-antennas/)
- Select atleast 2 antennae that we could potentially use for comms. But the relevant information in the Brain Dump doc on teams. You must be able to justify why you selected that particular piece of hardware. Chosen hardware must comply with the URC guidelines for communications equipment.

### 5. _Surprise Task_ :0
Just kidding, this task is a reminder for you to begin reading up on ROS!

### Additional Readings

- Pages 62 (from 4.3.6.3 Noise and Interference) to 71 (before 4.3.7 OPTICAL PROPAGATION BASICS) of [this document](https://public.ccsds.org/Pubs/880x0g3.pdf) explain the fundamentals of wireless communication using Antennae.
