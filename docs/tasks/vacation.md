Yay! End of semester == more time to do rover work!

At this point, I believe most of you all have read up on ROS/ attempted to read up on ROS. If not,
then a lot of the things we will cover from this point onwards will be mildly confusing. 

Again, the [tutorials on ROSWiki](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials) are VERY helpful and informative. Please do have a 
try at becoming familiarised with ROS.

Do not be concerned if you had a lot to do in the semester and could not focus on ROS. You have some time in the vacation 
to go through the basics.

Till then, let's cover some things to finish by the end of the vacation:

1. Creating a basic network with ROS and talking between different systems.
2. Place the orders on hardware like transceivers. 

## **Networking With ROS**

The great thing about open source software, is that we can gather ideas and _code_ from different matured systems to create
our own! (All whilst citing and crediting sources appropriately)

Please go through these existing ROS networking packages, which have claimed to been tried and tested by their developers:
- [nimbro_network by AIS-Bonn](https://github.com/AIS-Bonn/nimbro_network)
- [network_interface by astuff](https://github.com/astuff/network_interface)

Add any other packages you find interesting/useful in the _Brain Dump_ on teams.

We should have a meeting soon, to finalise the rest of the HW components and start setting up the existing software.
